          A Legacy of Purpose in Every Product
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm font-extralight">
          Born from a deep desire to empower students through meaningful
          exchange, our journey began in a close-knit college community where
          everyday challenges sparked innovative solutions. What started as a
          simple idea to help peers has grown into a heartfelt mission: to
          connect students through reliable, purpose-driven products that carry
          value and stories.

        <p className="text-sm font-extralight">
          Rooted in trust and community, our story began with the exchange of
          used books, lab kits, and tools among classmates. These weren‚Äôt just
          transactions‚Äîthey were shared experiences. Over time, we saw the power
          of a student-to-student marketplace that not only saved money but also
          built connection. Today, we carry forward that spirit, creating a
          platform where students can buy or sell their products with
          confidence, care, and community at its core.
